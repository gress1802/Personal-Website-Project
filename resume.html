The first file is used to keep an out of memory copy of each node and its contents. The whole tree is never fully built in memory; the tree is traversed node by node jumping from address to address in the BTree random access file. The other file is a database table. The leaves of the B+ Tree point to addresses in this file which contain the data inserted into the tree. <br> <br> <a target = "_blank" class = "githubLink" href = "https://github.com/gress1802/B-Tree">B+ Tree Github</a> <br> </p>
